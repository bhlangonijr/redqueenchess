	Redqueen Chess Engine
	Copyright (C) 2008-2012 Ben-Hur Carlos Vieira Langoni Junior

Introduction ---------------------------------------------------------------------

	RedQueen is a free and open source chess program available for 
	Windows and Linux. The code has been written in C++ using minimal 
	library dependencies as possible, so that it could be easily ported 
	to other OS. RedQueen is an UCI chess engine which means that you 
	will need to have installed on your computer a chess graphic 
	interface such as Arena or XBoard/Winboard to be able to play with it.
	The name RedQueen comes from the Red Queen character in Lewis 
	Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass novel.

Usage ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Please follow the instructions of your favorite GUI (Arena, 
	Winboard/Xboard, Scid, Chessbase, etc) to install the engine on it.
	
	RedQueen can be executed from the command line of your Operating
	System. The command:
	
	redqueen bench
	
	will run a benchmark using a pre-defined set of chess positions.
	
	Running RedQueen without arguments will make it enter in the UCI mode. 
	You can query the UCI specification to learn about the
	available commands:
	
	http://www.shredderchess.com/chess-info/features/uci-universal-chess-interface.html
	
	RedQueen have a special command not specified in the UCI
	documentation. In the UCI mode you can type the command 'test eval'
	which will display a detailed information on the evaluation of
	the current chess position. Example.:

Acknowledgments --------------------------------------------------------------------

	RedQueen was completely written from the scratch. Although it has taken 
	many ideas from many open source projects.
		
	The following open source projects had directly influenced the 
	development of RedQueen:
	
	Stockfish
	Sloppy
	Sungorus   	
	Robbolito
	Crafty
	Gull
	
	RedQueen uses the magic move bitboard generation by Pradyumna Kannan.
	
	RedQueen uses the mersenne twister PRNG by Takuji Nishimura and 
	Makoto Matsumoto
